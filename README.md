# Power-BI-Healthcare-Analytic-Dashboard

## Project Description:
This project focuses on building an interactive and visually insightful Power BI dashboard to analyze healthcare data. The dashboard provides key performance indicators (KPIs), trends, and insights into various aspects of healthcare operations, including patient care, hospital performance, resource allocation, and financial metrics. The dashboard uses data from multiple sources to generate actionable insights for healthcare managers, doctors, and administrators.

## Technologies Used:
- Power BI
- KPI (Key Performance Indicator)
- Excel (for data cleaning)
- PPT (Power Point Presentation)

## Dataset:
The dataset contains medical records including patient demographics (name, age, gender), health information (blood type, medical condition), and treatment details (doctor, hospital, medication, test results), along with billing and admission specifics.

## Key Features:
- Patient Demographics: Visualizations to explore patient age, gender, and geographical distribution.
- Hospital Performance: Metrics to analyze hospital admission rates, patient discharge rates, and occupancy.
- Resource Management: Analysis of staff availability, equipment utilization, and room allocation.
- Financial Analytics: Visualizations for revenue, expenses, and profitability across departments.
- Trends & Forecasting: Use of historical data for trend analysis and predictive insights for future hospital needs.
- Customizable Filters: Interactive slicers for users to filter data by various dimensions (e.g., date, department, patient type).
